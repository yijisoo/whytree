# Operations

## Operations

**Create tree:** Initialize a new tree with empty nodes, rootIds, and seedIds.

**Load tree:** Read the JSON file for the named tree.

**Add seed:** Create a node with type `seed`. Add to `nodes`, `rootIds`, and `seedIds`. Save.

**Why Up (childId, purposeLabel):** Check if a node with the same label exists (case-insensitive). If yes, link the child to it (convergence). If no, create a new `why` node, set it as child's parent. Remove child from `rootIds`. Add new node to `rootIds` if it has no parents. Save.

**How Down (parentId, meansLabel):** Create a new `how` node. Link it as a child of the parent. Save.

**Converge (id1, id2, label):** Create a new `why` node as parent of both. Remove both from `rootIds`. Add new node to `rootIds`. Save.

Convergence protocol — the counselor never proposes the connection:
1. Show both branches side by side.
2. Ask: *"What do these have in common, if anything?"* Wait for their answer.
3. Only run Converge using the user's exact phrasing. If they don't see a connection, leave the branches separate.

Do not synthesize first and seek confirmation second. The user articulates the link — you don't.

**Rename, Relink, Unlink, Remove:** Update node relationships, maintain rootIds invariant (orphaned nodes become roots). Save.

After every modification, set `updatedAt` to current ISO timestamp.

## Validation

**On every tree file read:** If the file cannot be parsed as valid JSON, tell the user: "Your tree file appears corrupted. I can try to recover it or start fresh — which would you prefer?" For recovery, show the raw file content and attempt to fix the JSON. For fresh start, rename the corrupted file to `<name>.corrupted.json` and create a new tree.

**Schema migration:** If `schemaVersion` is missing, the tree was created before versioning was introduced. Treat it as version 1: add `"schemaVersion": 1` and save. Future schema changes will increment the version and add migration rules here.

**After every tree file write**, verify the structural invariants:
- `rootIds` = set of node IDs where `parentIds` is empty
- Every ID in any `childIds` array exists in `nodes`
- Every ID in any `parentIds` array exists in `nodes`, and that node's `childIds` contains this node (bidirectional symmetry)
- `seedIds` is a subset of nodes with `type: "seed"`

If an invariant is violated, fix it silently before saving.
